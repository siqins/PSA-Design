# PSA-Design

Machine learning-assisted materials genome approach to design the silicon-containing arylacetylenes (PSAs) with enhanced dielectric and thermal properties for different application scenarios.

## Data

The data comprising the dielectric (*i.e.*, Dielectric constant *ε* and loss tan*δ*) and heat resistance properties (*i.e.*, *T*d5, an indicator of thermal stability) of polymers were collected from from various sources, including literatures, handbooks, the PolyInfo database, and the [AI plus Polymers](http://47.100.230.202/index/) database. 

## Usage

-- [data](data): contains the data files.

-- [models](models): contains the code for models training and prediction.
